# File-Tracker

1.	Download XAMPP: Visit the official website of Apache Friends (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the appropriate XAMPP installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
2.	Run the Installer:
•	For Windows: Double-click the downloaded installer file (e.g., xampp-windows-x64-x.x.x-x-installer.exe) to start the installation process.
•	For macOS: Open the downloaded DMG file and drag the XAMPP icon to the Applications folder.
•	For Linux: Navigate to the directory where the installer is downloaded and execute the installer with appropriate permissions. For example, in the terminal, you can use sudo chmod +x <installer-filename> to make it executable, and then sudo ./<installer-filename> to run it.
3.	Follow the Installation Wizard: The installation wizard will guide you through the installation process. You can choose the components you want to install (e.g., Apache, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin), select the installation directory, and proceed with the installation.
4.	Start XAMPP Control Panel:
•	For Windows: After installation, XAMPP Control Panel should open automatically. If not, you can find it in the Start menu or launch it from the installation directory.
•	For macOS and Linux: You can start XAMPP Control Panel from the Applications folder (macOS) or through the terminal by navigating to the XAMPP directory and running sudo ./xampp start.
5.	Start Apache and MySQL: In the XAMPP Control Panel, click on the "Start" button next to Apache and MySQL modules. This will start the Apache web server and MySQL database server.
6.	Verify Installation: Open a web browser and enter http://localhost in the address bar. If XAMPP is installed correctly, you should see the XAMPP dashboard.
7.	Optional Configuration:
•	If you need to change any configuration settings (e.g., PHP settings, Apache configurations), you can do so by editing the respective configuration files located in the XAMPP installation directory.
•	You may also want to set up security measures, such as setting passwords for MySQL and securing phpMyAdmin.
That's it! XAMPP is now installed on your system.

To start a website using XAMPP, you'll typically follow these steps:
1.	Prepare Your Website Files:
•	Ensure that your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, etc.) are stored in the appropriate directory. By default, for Apache, this directory is htdocs located in your XAMPP installation directory.
2.	Start XAMPP and Apache:
•	Launch the XAMPP Control Panel.
•	Start the Apache server by clicking the "Start" button next to Apache in the control panel. If Apache is already running, it will say "Stop" instead of "Start".
3.	Access Your Website:
•	Open a web browser.
•	Enter http://localhost/ in the address bar.
•	Enter Fts.sql file in phpmyadmin to create Database.
•	If your website files are stored directly in the htdocs directory, you can access your website by entering http://localhost/File-Tracker (File-Tracker) is the name of the folder containing your website files.
4.	Verify Your Website:
•	Your website should now be accessible in the web browser. You can navigate through your website to ensure it's working as expected.
That's it! Your website should now be up and running locally using XAMPP.
